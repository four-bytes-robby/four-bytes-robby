## 🤯 Past & Development fun facts

- Started with 64k cassette storage computers: ATARI 800 XL + Datasette.
- Was always dreaming of a Mega ST Setup with hard drive (!). Bought this later, yet had it only to test a few weeks.
- First PC 286, developing with Turbo Pascal TP.
- Eventually switched to Borland Pascal with Protected Mode Support with 386 platform, combined with TASM.
- Started to build my own OS before Windows including graphics driver stack. Anyone remember smooth scrolling with sprite hacks?
- Was super interested in the demo scene.
- Developed super fast FLI and MOD player.
- Fun but necessary: memory resident DOS CD player (must be around as 7+ archive in the amateur radio boxes).
- Hacking dos games to prevent copy protection popping up - but only for myself of course.
